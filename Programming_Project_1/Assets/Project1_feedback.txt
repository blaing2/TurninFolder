Most features successfully implemented:

Innovations:
- Character projectiles use raycasting to inform enemies if they're in danger of being hit.
	Enemies move out of the path of projectiles as best they can, requiring a barrage
	in order to successfully clear them out.
- HUD showing number of enemies remaining.

	
Bug:
- The end camera is enabled at the start of the game, overriding the player camera and
	making the game unplayable in the editor. The build is okay. Remember to always
	make sure that only one camera is active at a time.
